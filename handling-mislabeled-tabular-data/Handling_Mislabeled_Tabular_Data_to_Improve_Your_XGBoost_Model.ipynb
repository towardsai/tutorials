    "# Handling Mislabeled Tabular Data to Improve Your XGBoost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cmauck10/towardsai-tutorials/blob/master/handling-mislabeled-tabular-data/Handling_Mislabeled_Tabular_Data_to_Improve_Your_XGBoost_Model.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook highlights data-centric AI techniques (using [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab)) to improve the accuracy of an XGBoost classifier (reducing prediction errors by 70% on the noisy dataset considered here!). These techniques involve optimizing the dataset itself rather than altering the model's architecture or hyperparameters. As a result, it is possible to achieve further improvements in accuracy by fine-tuning the model in conjunction with the newly enhanced data. Additionally, the enhancements made to the dataset through these methods are transferable to other modeling and analytical endeavors, as opposed to being specific to a particular type of model.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level we will:\n",
    "- Establish a baseline accuracy of XGBoost model on the original data.\n",
    "- Use cleanlab's `find_label_issues()` to highlight hundreds of mislabeled data points. \n",
    "- Remove the data with automatically-flagged label issues from the dataset, and then retrain the exact same XGBoost model. This simple step **reduces the error in model predictions by 36%!** The raw difference in accuracy values between the two XGBoost models **8%**.\n",
    "- Manually correct the label issues of all examples found by `find_label_issues()`, which **reduces the error in model predictions by 70%** from the baseline, identical XGBoost model!"

    "Let's take a look at our student grades tabular dataset. The data includes three exam scores (numerical features), a written note (categorical feature with missing values), and a (noisy) letter grade (categorical label). Our aim is to train a model to classify the grade for each student based on the other features, but 20% of the grade labels in this dataset are actually incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for this demonstration, we have access to the true letter grade each student should've received, which we use for evaluating both the underlying accuracy of model predictions and how well cleanlab detects which data are mislabeled. These true grades are only reserved for evaluation, they are not present in the dataset used for ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your noisily-labeled datasets, there will typically be no such ground truth, and therefore addressing label issues is even more important to facilitate proper model evaluation."

If our tabular data consisted solely of numerical and boolean values, we could potentially utilize a simpler model such as a nearest-neighbor or logistic regression. However, our data includes a notes column, which we will treat as a categorical feature. Fortunately, XGBoost (>v1.6) is able to handle mixed data types (numerical and categorical) by setting the `enable_categorical` parameter to `true`, thereby simplifying the modeling process."

    "\n",
    "For the student grades dataset, we found that **simply dropping identified label errors and retraining the model resulted in a 36% reduction in prediction error** on our classification problem (with accuracy improving from 79% to 87%). \n",
    "\n",
    "Going one step further, we manually fixed the incorrect labels, **resulting in a 70% reduction in prediction error** (with accuracy improving from 79% to 94%).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using open-source libraries for data-centric AI like [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) to ensure the integrity of your data, you can mitigate costly labeling errors and boost the performance of your models.\n",
